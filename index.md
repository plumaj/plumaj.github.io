Hi, I'm a Computational Linguist with a strong interest in information extraction, multilingual natural language processing and sentiment analysis. I specialise in extracting, processing and compiling textual data for use with machine/deep learning.

I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg. I am part of the [Culture and Computation Lab](https://cucolab.uni.lu/), a transversal research unit that promotes Cultural Data Science at the Department of Humanities.
